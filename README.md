# Anandvan, Homestay Management App

This is a single-folder, client-side web application for managing bookings, expenses, and invoices for Anandvan.

## How to Run

1.  **Local Use**: Simply open the `login.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
2.  **Web Server / WordPress**:
    * Place all the files (`index.html`, `login.html`, `style.css`, `config.js`, `tool.js`, and your `logo.png`) into a single folder.
    * Upload this folder to your web server using FTP or a file manager plugin in WordPress.
    * Navigate to `your-domain.com/your-folder-name/login.html` to access the application.

## Configuration

* To change the **login PIN**, edit the `pin` value in `config.js`. The default is "1111".

* To change the **business details** (name, address, etc.), you can either edit the defaults in `config.js` or change them in the "Settings" tab within the app itself.
